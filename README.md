## 🚀 What's AI-RS All About?
Just a simple Neural Network to practice and remember basic AI concepts, matrix manipulation, and obviously, Rust.

## 📚 Resources We Raided
I didn't reinvent the wheel (or neuron) from scratch. Here's what I used to make this magic happen:

- **The Rust Programming Book 📖**: This trusty tome by No Starch Press served as my treasure map. Get a copy, you won't regret it 🦀

- **3blue1brown YouTube Series 🎥**: I owe a debt of gratitude to Grant Sanderson for his amazing explainer videos. Dive into the world of neural networks with his YouTube series. 🌟

- **Articles 📝**: [This one](https://medium.com/coinmonks/representing-neural-network-with-vectors-and-matrices-c6b0e64db9fb) and [this one](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/75855/what-types-of-matrix-multiplication-are-used-in-machine-learning-when-are-they)

- **A Sh*t Ton of Googling 🌐**: Let's be real, this is where all the real learning happens. I've googled my way through errors, confusion, and eureka moments. 🕵️‍♂️💡


## 📝 Important note
Learning Rust is hard, AI also collaborated on making this (copilot) so go ahead, read something you are curious about and try coding it. 👷‍♂️

#### PS: I still have no idea on how to properly use lifetimes 🥲 and can barely code anything more complex than this in rust hehe.
